"""Filesystem sandbox for the agent subprocess.

Builds a `bwrap` (bubblewrap) argv prefix that limits the agent's filesystem
view to a single worktree, read-only. This enforces the multi-tenant boundary:
even a prompt-injected agent reading absolute paths cannot reach another
tenant's repo cache.

Network is intentionally left shared — the agent must call the model API. Only
the filesystem is restricted.

When the sandbox engages, the subprocess is also spawned with a scrubbed,
allowlisted environment (`build_subprocess_env`) so baloo's secrets (GitHub
key, DB creds, etc.) are not exposed to a potentially prompt-injected agent
that has open network access — filesystem isolation alone does not address
exfiltration.
